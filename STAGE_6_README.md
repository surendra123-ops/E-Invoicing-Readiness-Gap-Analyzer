# Stage 6: Database Persistence & History

This stage implements comprehensive database persistence for all application data and enables users to revisit their past analyses.

## Features Implemented

### Backend
- **Database Models** - MongoDB schemas for Upload, FieldMapping, Validation, and Report entities
- **Persistent Storage** - All data now stored in MongoDB instead of memory
- **History Management** - Track and retrieve past analyses with pagination
- **Status Tracking** - Upload status progression (uploaded → mapped → validated → completed)
- **Data Relationships** - Proper references between uploads, mappings, validations, and reports

### Frontend
- **History Component** - View all past uploads with status and scores
- **Resume Analysis** - Continue incomplete analyses from any step
- **Download Management** - Re-download reports from previous analyses
- **Status Indicators** - Visual status badges and score indicators

## Database Schema

### Upload Model
- `uploadId` - Unique identifier
- `originalFilename` - Original file name
- `fileType` - CSV or JSON
- `rowsParsed` - Number of rows processed
- `preview` - First 20 rows with type detection
- `rawData` - Complete parsed data
- `status` - Current analysis status
- `expiresAt` - Auto-cleanup after 7 days

### FieldMapping Model
- `mappingId` - Unique identifier
- `uploadId` - Reference to upload
- `mappings` - Field mapping object
- `autoSuggest` - Whether mappings were auto-suggested
- `standardFields` - GETS schema reference

### Validation Model
- `validationId` - Unique identifier
- `uploadId` - Reference to upload
- `mappingId` - Reference to field mapping
- `results` - Complete validation results
- `fieldMappings` - Mapping data snapshot

### Report Model
- `reportId` - Unique identifier
- `uploadId` - Reference to upload
- `validationId` - Reference to validation
- `reportData` - Complete report data
- `format` - Report format (json/csv/pdf)
- `downloadCount` - Track download usage

## API Endpoints

### Upload Management
- `POST /upload` - Upload file (now saves to DB)
- `POST /upload/json` - Upload JSON payload (now saves to DB)
- `GET /upload/:uploadId` - Get upload details
- `GET /upload/history` - Get paginated upload history

### Field Mapping
- `POST /fields/map` - Save field mappings to DB
- `GET /fields/mappings/:uploadId` - Get mappings from DB

### Validation
- `POST /rules/check` - Run validation (now saves to DB)
- `GET /rules/results/:validationId` - Get validation results
- `GET /rules/upload/:uploadId` - Get validation by upload ID

### Reports
- `GET /reports/:uploadId?format=json|csv|pdf` - Generate/download reports
- `GET /reports/:uploadId/summary` - Get report summary

## History Features

### Upload History
- Paginated list of all uploads
- Status indicators (Uploaded, Mapped, Validated, Completed)
- Score badges with color coding
- Action buttons based on status

### Resume Analysis
- Continue incomplete analyses from any step
- Load existing data for completed analyses
- Generate new reports from existing validations

### Report Management
- Re-download previous reports
- Track download counts
- Support for all formats (JSON, CSV, PDF)

## Data Flow

1. **Upload** → Save to Upload collection with status 'uploaded'
2. **Field Mapping** → Save to FieldMapping collection, update Upload status to 'mapped'
3. **Validation** → Save to Validation collection, update Upload status to 'validated'
4. **Report Generation** → Save to Report collection, update Upload status to 'completed'
5. **History** → Query all collections to show comprehensive history

## Integration with Previous Stages

- **Stage 1**: Basic structure maintained
- **Stage 2**: Upload data now persists in database
- **Stage 3**: Field mappings stored with relationships
- **Stage 4**: Validation results saved with full context
- **Stage 5**: Reports generated from persisted data
- **Stage 6**: Complete history and resume functionality

## Benefits

- **Data Persistence** - No more lost analyses on server restart
- **History Tracking** - Complete audit trail of all analyses
- **Resume Capability** - Continue interrupted analyses
- **Performance** - Efficient queries with proper indexing
- **Scalability** - Ready for multi-user scenarios
- **Data Integrity** - Proper relationships and validation

## Next Steps

The application is now complete with full database persistence. Future enhancements could include:
- User authentication and multi-tenancy
- Advanced reporting and analytics
- API rate limiting and caching
- Data export and backup features
- Integration with external systems
